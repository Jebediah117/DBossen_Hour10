    I do think the game is too easy and it's because of how speratic the balls can be. Sometimes they go in instantly while other times it takes forever for them to get in.

    I think something that would make it harder is a goalee. Imagine if each goal had a moving bumper that could block the balls from going in. It would make it far more difficult especially with how the balls act.

    I think something that would give it a wow factor is fun sound effects. The game is essentially pinball so having fun sound effects for when things hit each other would make the game far more satisfying and intersting.
   

    The part of the game that is fun is seeing the balls bounce around. Bouncing the ball off the wall and into the goal is very satisfying and fun. The part that is tedious is the speed of the player. The balls are very fast and with how slow we are it can often feel like the player cant do anything or has no purpose. 

     The 4 suggestions I did are:
    1.Try adding variations of the chaos balls 
    added 2 more balls with different sizes and speed
    2.Try changing the size and shape of the player's bumper
    added 2 cylinder bumpers as well as more rectangles of different sizes
    3.try making a complex bumper out of many shapes
    added a doorway style obstacle and a archway style obstacle
    4.try adding something over the water outside the arena
    created stands outside the arena
