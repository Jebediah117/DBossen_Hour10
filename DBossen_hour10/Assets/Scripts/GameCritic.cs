    I do think the game is too easy and it's because of how speratic the balls
    are. Some of the balls go in instantly before you even have any chance of
    noticing while others take forever to go in. 

    I think something that would make it harder is more obstacles. With more 
    obstacles there are more things for the balls to get stuck on and so more time
    before they end up in the goals.

    I think something that would give it a wow factor is fun sound effects. The game
    is simialir to pinball, so having some similair sound effects would make it pop
    more. Having different ones for hitting walls, balls, or obstacles would add a 
    lot.

    The part of the game that is fun is seeing the balls bounce around and watching
    them deal with obstacles. A ball may be about to go in and then get knocked out
    of the way. The part that is tedious is when the balls get stuck in a loop and
    take a while to get out. Early into making it that would happen a lot with the
    ball never coming close to going in because its in a loop.

     The 4 suggestions I did are:
    1.Try adding variations of the chaos balls 
    added 2 more balls with different sizes and speed
    2.Try changing the size and shape of the player's bumper
    added 2 cylinder bumpers as well as more rectangles of different sizes
    3.try making a complex bumper out of many shapes
    added a doorway style obstacle and a archway style obstacle
    4.try adding something over the water outside the arena
    created stands outside the arena
